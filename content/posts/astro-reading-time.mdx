## Intro

I recently tried to move my website to Astro, but I wanted to keep most of the existing features.

As you can see in the blog page, the list of blog posts include the time it takes to read each post.

This feature in Astro requires quite a bit of work to be implemented.

## The "official" way

If you followed the [official docs](https://jahir.dev/blog/astro-reading-time) recipe, first you need to install 2 packages:

```sh
yarn add -D reading-time mdast-util-to-string
```

TSX example:

```tsx title="remark-reading-time.mjs"
"use client";

import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";
import { ReactNode } from "react";

export function Providers({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="system" enableSystem>
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

Then, you create a custom Remark plugin to add the reading time to the frontmatter property of your blog posts.
